# Obsidian Config
This repository contains my custom configuration for initializing new Obsidian vaults. It includes settings, themes, and plugins.

## Installation

To use this configuration in your Obsidian vault:

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curtainteddy/obsidian-config.git
   ```
   _(Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.)_

2. Navigate to your Obsidian vault directory. The path typically looks like this:
   ```bash
   /path/to/your/vault
   ```
3. Locate the **.obsidian** folder in your vault directory. If it doesn't exist, create one.

4. Copy all the contents of this repository into the **.obsidian** folder of your vault directory. Overwrite any existing files if prompted.

5. Open your vault in Obsidian. The new configuration should load automatically.

## Usage
This configuration includes:

- Custom themes
- Pre-configured plugins
- Hotkeys
  
# To ensure everything works as expected:

1. Check the **Settings > Community Plugins** section in Obsidian to make sure all plugins are installed and enabled.
2. If any plugins are missing, search for them in the **Community Plugin** browser and install them manually.
3. Review the **Settings** to tweak the configuration to your liking if necessary and make sure to check for updates for the installed plugins.

## Notes

> **âš  Important:**  
> Back up your existing `.obsidian` folder before applying this configuration if you wish to retain your previous settings.
