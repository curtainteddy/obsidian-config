Here, the number of trials (n) is 5, the probability of success (getting heads, p) is 0.5, and the probability of failure (getting tails, ) is also 0.5. Using the binomial formula: L n—k P =k =(})ta-p Where (:) is the combination formula. So, for 3 heads out of 5 tosses: 5 P(X=3)= (3) (0.5)%(0.5)° = 10 x 0.125 x 0.25 = 0.3125","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":"eng"}
